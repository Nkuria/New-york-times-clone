          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
          Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
          far beyond the world of known physics. He was trying to understand why
          there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
          created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made
          the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed
          course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
          special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to
          swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
          instant. If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why
          the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
          warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles
          and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
          diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean. “SPECTACULAR
          REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a
          double box around it.
          <br />

          On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
          that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
          hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right. Reaching
          back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with
          telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M.
          Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected
          ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves —
          the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was
          roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old.
          They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr.
          Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

          Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
          many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved. If
          corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science
          comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe
          apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time
          and space and energy to science and speculation. Confirming inflation
          would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years
          in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an
          infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and
          fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be
          an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity,
          like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2 class="as-big t-align-left">‘As Big as It Gets’</h2>
          <br />
          In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
          operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
          accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr.
          Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational
          waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity,
          should ruffle space-time. Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins
          University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
          said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.” He continued, “This is a
          signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
          gravitational waves.” The ripples manifested themselves as faint
          spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space
          and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old
          and as hot as the surface of the sun. Dr. Kovac and his collaborators,
          working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
          Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a
          scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and
          in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

          Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one
          in 10 million.<br />

          Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not
          expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime. “With nature,
          you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.” The
          results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of
          observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr.
          Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting
          with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of
          Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in
          1979), in his office last week. “It was a very special moment, and one
          we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his
          words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes. Andrei Linde of
          Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular
          variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about
          to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a
          Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his
          door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the news.

          Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered
          anything. “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that
          this was a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but
          I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde
          wrote in an email. Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island,
          Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this
          is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said. By last weekend, as
          social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and
          news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation
          and caution. Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email,
          “I think that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the
          greatest discoveries in the history of science.” John E. Carlstrom of
          the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing
          project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply
          impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he
          said. Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to
          inflation that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of
          genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his
          model, but he expressed reservations about inflation. Lawrence M.
          Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for
          confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates
          based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European
          Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the
          universe. “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and
          down,” Dr. Krauss said. Corroboration might not be long in coming. The
          Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this year. At least a
          dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons,
          mountaintops and space. Spirals in the Sky Gravity waves are the
          latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves,
          which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson
          at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize. Dr. Kovac has
          spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one
          of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly
          sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air
          creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of
          the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of
          Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford. “The South Pole is the closest you
          can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has
          been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been
          hooked ever since,” he said.

            The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the
            faint spiraling gravity patterns — the signature of a universe being
            wrenched violently apart at its birth.
          </p>
          In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave
          radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight
          preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another. This was a
          step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves
          from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and
          stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of
          polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of
          the polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in
          spirals. Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally
          small differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s
          telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.
          “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said. The
          strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a
          year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had
          things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the
          breakthrough. A Special Time The data traced the onset of inflation to
          a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto
          house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the
          evolution of the universe. Physicists recognize four forces at work in
          the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak
          nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply
          different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the
          universe in its earliest, hottest moments. As the universe cooled,
          according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old
          folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The
          laws of physics evolved, with one force after another splitting away.
          That was where Dr. Guth came in. Under some circumstances, a glass of
          water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees, until
          it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing
          latent heat. Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a
          unified state too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued
          with a mysterious latent energy. Inserted into Einstein’s equations,
          the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe
          would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the
          repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed
          apart. What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at
          least a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of
          primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic
          eye-blink. Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into
          ordinary particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was
          still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky
          and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there
          is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the
          universe might be the ultimate free lunch.” Make that free lunches.
          Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original
          vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our
          own universe settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest
          of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles
          endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse. So the future of the
          cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about
          going any deeper into the past. We might never know what happened
          before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases
          everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the
          primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our view. “If you
          trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian
          astronomer who was not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”
